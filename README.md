# 2ndYr_Assignment3_RoboBeArduino
For this assignment our idea is to build and develop
a robotic teddy bear that can encourage and motivate children
to brush their teeth.

As the name of our repo suggests, we are planning on using arduino
to bring our teddy bear into life and hoping to collect the data 
and visualise it through processing.

The features of the robot that will help motivate the kids to brush includes:
-music(audio)
-timer
-camera

"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying,
sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do. "
