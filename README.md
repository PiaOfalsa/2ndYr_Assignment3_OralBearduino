## Objective
For this project, our initial idea was to create a __notification system__ that can encourage and motivate children to brush their teeth in a fun, IoT(Internet of Things) environment. 


We then came up to the conclusion that we will use the platform of Arduino and develop an Android App which offers awesome IoT features - make sure to check down below for the full post about the features that are showcased in our project.


## Hardware Specs 
* Usage of Genymotion Emulator for Android App
* TFT LCD Screen:
  * Arduino Uno
* Wemos D1-mini with an ESP8266 WiFi Module:
  * Vibration Switch Sensor
  * Resistor
  * Jumper Wires
  * Breadboard

## Project Description
We divided the workload in two phases so we could learn both platforms at once. As a duo group, we thought the project per se was ambitious at first but we believe we managed to consider and tackle every necessary steps possible. 

With the objective in mind, our Android App - named after the project -  was made primarily for the parents to notify them once their children have used the toothbrush recently via a vibration switch sensor input read by Wemos D1-Mini with ESP8266. As for the kids' motivation counterpart, we decided to use a TFT LCD Screen embodied inside a stuff toy to display tips and advices and more importantly, a stop watch for the recommended two-minute duration of brushing.

## Goals
* Learning curve in both platforms
* Developing an Android App with fragments on a Navigation Bar
* Learn Arduino in C and C++; Arduino library functions
* Understanding the hardwares of TFT LCD screen i.e. Touchpoint and Wemos D1-Mini i.e. ESP8266 libraries
* Usage of base64 for encoding username and password from the SMTP server
* Git fetching-> merging/rebasing from an upstream branch was also another challenge in the beginning


## Features
#### 
* Android App:
   * Jukebox on Home Page
   * Tutorial Page
   * E-mail 
* Wemos D1- Mini:
  * The controller uses the ESP8266 to send an email once the vibration switch sensor reads an analogue input
  

* TFT LCD Screen
  * Tips Advices on Splash Screens
  * Stop Watch for the recommended 2 minutes!
