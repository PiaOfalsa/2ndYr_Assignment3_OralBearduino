        with your child</string>

    <string name="long_string2">
        Children need an adult to assist with thorough brushing until they are 8 or 9 years old. Let them have a turn and then Mum or Dad have a turn to ensure teeth are clean.

Teeth can be brushed twice daily with fluoride containing toothpaste. A small, soft bristled brush is ideal for children. Regular daily flossing can start as soon as two teeth are in contact.
